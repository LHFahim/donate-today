          Donating is a selfless act. One of the major positive effects of
          donating money to charity is simply feeling good about giving. Being
          able to give back to those in need helps you achieve a greater sense
          of personal satisfaction and growth, it feels good to help others.

        <p class="donation-plan-par">
          Our charity is working on many areas tirelessly all the time. The list
          starts from giving people foods, medicine, shelter, safe haven in
          catastrophic regions, etc. Few examples are below.

          <h4>Food for a family</h4>
          <p>
            Aside from the immediate benefits to the members of our communities
            the planet benefits greatly as well. The less unspoiled food that
            gets thrown away, the less unspoiled food that is sent to a landfill
            where it ultimately goes to waste.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="shelter-plan">
          <img class="icon" src="icons/shelter.png" alt="" />
          <h4>Shelter for a family</h4>
          <p>
            Giving money will provide shelter. It will help the homeless in more
            ways than you may realize and the more money that is given, the more
            services and help can be provided. So we plead you to make donation
            for sheltering people in need.

          <h4>Education for a child</h4>
          <p>
            When you donate to a school, you can see your investment at work
            with burgeoning programs, watching students gain access to higher
            learning and broader opportunities. Paying it forward is the name of
            the game when you donate to a foundation. You are – literally –
            investing in the next generation.

          Donating to the causes you care about not only benefits the charities
          themselves, it can be deeply rewarding for you too. Millions of people
          give to charity on a regular basis to support causes they believe in,
          as well as for the positive effect it has on their own lives.
